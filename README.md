## CanvasLab

CanvasLab is a drawing application using React and TypeScript, incorporating Rough.js to achieve a sketchy, hand-drawn aesthetic. This side project was created for learning purposes, and while the app is not responsive, I concentrated on enhancing its functionalities, as I already have numerous responsive projects in my portfolio.

## Technologies

- React.js
- CSS
- TypeScript
- Rough.js

## Features

**Choose a Tool**: You have pencils, lines, rectangles, and text tools. Pick one and start creating.

**Draw and Move**: Click and drag on the canvas to draw. To move something, select it and drag it to a new spot. Also, resize elements by dragging the corners. Resizing only works on rectangles or lines.

**Edit Text**: Click on the canvas and start typing to add text to your drawings. You can also edit existing text.

**Zoom**: Use Ctrl + Scroll or click on the buttons to zoom in for detail or out to see the whole picture.

**Pan**: Hold the Space bar and drag or use the middle mouse button to move around the whiteboard canvas.
